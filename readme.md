# Kernel Debugging & WinDbg Cheat Sheet

My personal cheat sheet for using WinDbg for kernel debugging based on [repnz](https://repnz.github.io/)'s work.
This cheat sheet / mini guide will be updated as I do new stuff with WinDbg.

## Kernel Debugging Setup

### Installing the debugging tools

- To use windbg, you have to install the [Windows Debugging Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/).

### Setting a VM

Create a VM in Vmware Workstation and install Windows from ISO.

### Disable Windows Defender

When setting up a VM for debugging, it's useful to disable Windows Defender. It's recommended
for a couple of reasons:

- To save resources in the VM
- In case you want to execute malicious software, you don't want defender to prevent it's execution.

Follow these steps:

1. Turn it off from it's settings: Virus & Threat protection, Real-time protection, turn off.
Windows defender will start again in case you reboot, so we need to perform additional steps.
2. We can disable Windows Defender using gpedit.msc. In case your setup is Windows Home, gpedit
is disabled, so you need to download and run [GPEdit Enabler](https://www.itechtics.com/?dl_id=43). Run as admin and make sure you have an internet connection.
3. Run "gpedit.msc" -> Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Defender -> Turn Off Windows Defender -> Enabled

### Install VirtualKd

VirtualKd enables you to debug a VM by connecting over a named pipe.

- Download [VirtualKd Redux](https://github.com/4d61726b/VirtualKD-Redux/releases)
- The redux version is a newer version that supports Vmware 15 and has a few bugfixes.
- Extract VirtualKd in the host in any location you like (I like c:\tools\virtualkd)
- Run the "target" executable inside the guest
- Run vmmon64.exe / vmmon.exe on the host (According to the host's architecture)
- Configure the path of Windbg / Windbg Preview in vmmon.
- Make sure "Start Debugger Automatically" is not marked.

### Configure VM for debugging

Run the following commands in an admin command line.

- ```bcdedit /set testsigning on```
- ```bcdedit /debug on```
- ```bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:1 baudrate:115200```

### Connecting to the debugger

After these preparations, we can connect to the debugger by doing these steps:

1. Restart VM. click F8 and choose "Disable Device Signing Enforcement" - that will allow your driver to be load.  
2. At that point the VM will stuck. It will wait for the debugger to connect. Click "Run Debugger" in VMMON to connect

### Configuring Windbg

Now, the debugger should be connected to the VM. We need to setup some configurations in the
debugger:

- Setup symbols server: There are 2 ways to setup symbols path:
  - Environment Variable: This is the easier way I typically use. Set a new environment variable named _NT_SYMBOL_PATH with the
    following value: ```srv*c:\symbols\sym*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"```
  - You can also configure the symbols using a debugger command like this: ```.sympath srv*c:\symbols\sym*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"```

- If the debugger crashes / closes, you can just open a new debugger by clicking the "run debugger" button
- Arrange the windows / font however you like.

If you use the old Windbg, you should use "Save Workspace" after arranging the windows in the way you like, so next time you open WinDbg it will save this arrangement. It will also restore the symbol path.

### Configuring DbgPrint output

When debugging a driver, It's useful to be able to call [DbgPrintEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprintex) and see messages in the debugger
window. By default, all DbgPrint calls are filtered out. There are 3 ways to enable debugger messages:

1. In windbg, run ```ed nt!Kd_DEFAULT_MASK 0xF```. Kd_DEFAULT_MASK is a global variable inside 
ntoskrnl that is checked before printing messages to the debugger. If you write 0xF to this variable it means you want to get all messages. You will need to do this every time the machine reboots.
2. If you don't want to edit this variable every time the machine reboots, you can configure this
via registry. Run the following command (THIS REQUIRES A REBOOT.)

```bat
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter" /ve /t REG_DWORD /d 15
```

Because we use the "default mask" here you'll start to see every DbgPrint from all drivers so it can become pretty noisy. The other option is to filter by ComponentId. When you call DbgPrintEx, the first argument is a component id. Instead of setting the Kd_DEFAULT_MASK variable, you can
set a component-specific mask. For example:

1. Make sure that when you call DbgPrintEx, you specify the ```DPFLTR_IHVDRIVER_ID``` component.
2. Run the following command, to edit this component's mask:  ```ed nt!Kd_IHVDRIVER_Mask 0xf```
3. You can do it in the registry too, run the following command:

```bat
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter" /v IHVDRIVER /t REG_DWORD /d 15
``` 

## Initialization Commands

- !sym noisy - this will allow you to understand better why the debugger is stuck:)
- .kdfiles <map file> - this will save you some time by automatically loading the .sys file from the host machine,
	this way you won't need to copy the .sys file. The downside is that it doesn't work with user mode executables,
	so you need to find another method for them (copy pasting or using some kind of share)
- .reload - this will referesh the symbols.


## Installing and Loading Device Drivers

Installing a driver is done by registering it in the registry under the services key. Loading the driver is done by calling the 
NtLoadDriver syscall.

You can either:

- Use [Osr Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=157.htm) - This works on win 7-10
- Use builtin SC tool (only win10)
  - Use "sc create [service name] binPath= [path to your .sys file] type= kernel" to install the driver 
  - Use "sc start [service name]" to load the driver
  - Use "sc stop [service name]" to unload the driver
  - Use "sc delete [service name]" to uninstall the driver

If there the DriverEntry function returns an error status, it will be returned to "sc" / OsrLoader and the driver will be unloaded without
calling DriverUnload.

To debug your own driver, move it into the virtual machine and install it. Then you are welcome to put a breakpoint on the DriverEntry
by using "bu DriverName!DriverEntry" and then start the driver. If you want to update the code (say you found a bug..) then you can 
stop the driver, recompile, move the files into the VM, and start the driver again. 

## General WinDbg

- ```.<command>``` - run a command. This command is built-into the debugger
- ```!<command>``` - run an extension. Some extensions arrive by default, like "!process"
- Control-Break - Abort Long Running Operation / Debug Break
- ```.hh``` - open a comprehensive Windbg Help reference in a separate GUI window

## Exploring Modules And Symbols

Symbols are important when examining modules. When examining a certain module we always need to verify it's symbols
are loaded. We can use the ```lm``` command to see which modules are loaded right now - for each module we can see the
status of the symbols. Basically information about loaded modules is not 'updated' unless ```.reload``` is used before.
use .reload when changing the process context or when you're missing a specific modules in the list.

- ```.reload``` to reload symbols of loaded modules. Typically used to load symbols of modules that weren't loaded before
- You may want to use <code>!sym noisy</code> to diagnose symbol loading errors.
- ```.reload /u``` - unload symbols. This is used to release the .pdb file of compiled code.
  - Sometimes it's needed to forcefully close handles to PDB files because WinDbg does not close them.
  (using process explorer or process hacker..)
- ```lm``` (List Modules): Prints list of loaded modules
- ```x``` (Examine): Prints loaded symbols - ```x <module_name>!<symbol_name>``` - you can use wildcard on both sides
    - Search for a function by name: ```x MyDllName!FunctionName```
    - Search for a function with wildcards ```x MyDllName!*Func``` (ends with Func)
- ```ln <address>``` (List Nearest Symbols) - displays the symbols at or near the given address

## Source Navigation

- ```.open -a <symbol>``` - open the source file with this symbol
	
## Breakpoints

These are the commands for int3 breakpoints.
- `bp` - normal breakpoint
- Breakpoint On DriverEntry - If your driver is not loaded yet, you cannot use "bp MyDriver!DriverEntry" because this symbol
is not known yet. You can use the "bu" command, this allows to put a breakpoint on the driver entry because those breakpoints are calculated when a driver is loaded. Another trick to break at the load of drivers (Useful in case you don't have symbols) is breaking
in ntoskrnl.exe where DriverEntry is called. (For example, IopLoadDriver)
- ```bl``` - list breakpoints
- ```bc *``` / ```bc <breakpoint_id>``` - clear breakpoint
- ```bp /1 <location>``` - temporary breakpoint (break 1 time..)
- Breaking on source lines - 
	- You can use F9 while placing the cursor on a specific line of code.
	- Old Method: Find the source line using the status bar and run <code>bp `<sourcefile>:<line>`</code>
	- Sometimes this method is too slow because it cannot know which module you are trying to break on, so it'll
	start downloading symbols of other modules....
	- ```bp `module_name!file.cpp:206` ``` is better - specifies the name of the module

- ```bp /p <EPROCESS address> <breakpoint address>``` - Break on a specific process - 
	say you want your breakpoint to be on only for a specific process, you can use /p to do it
  
- ```bp /t <ETHREAD address> <breakpoint address>``` - same as above, for threads.

- ```bp <options> "<command">``` - this will run a windbg command after breaking. You can combine multipile commands using ';' for example:

This command will break at line 385 in the ProcessProtector.c file in the ProcessProtector module and it will print 
basic process information, a stack trace, and it will continue on.
Limit the number of times the breakpoint hits to prevent floods:

```
bp /5 `ProcessProtector!ProcessProtector.c:385` "!process -1 0; k; g"
```

Break right before the process entry point in kernel debugging:
```
bp ntdll!LdrpInitializeProcess "bp /1 KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk; g"
```
### On access breakpoit a.k.a. data breakpoint

This breakpoint is triggered when the specified memory is accessed (for read, write or execute operation). This breakpoint type uses special debug CPU registers: DR0, DR1, DR2, DR3 for linear addresses to stop on, and DR6, DR7 - for debug flags. So in total it's possible to set up only 4 access breakpoints at the same time.

- `ba w 4 0x000002e1`6e9d6648` : break when 4 bytes at given address will be overwritten

### Conditional breakpoints 

Conditional breakpoints allows you to break if a some DX expression evaluates to true.

## Analyzing BugChecks

- <code>analyze -v</code>: Shows detailed information about the exception

## Tracing and Stepping

- (F5) `g` : (go) continue
- (F10) : step over
- (F11) : step into
- (Shoft + F11) `gu` : (go up, Step Out) - execute until the current function is complete
- `tt` - Trace until next return (stops before ret CPU instruction)
- `pc` (Step to Next Call) - executes the program until a call instruction is reached.

## Analyzing Program State

- Use memory window to see raw memory
- use `dt` (Display Type) to observe data structures:
```
kd> dt ntdll!_RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS 000002e16e9d5ec0 
   +0x000 MaximumLength    : 0x788
   +0x004 Length           : 0x788
   +0x008 Flags            : 1
   +0x00c DebugFlags       : 0
   +0x010 ConsoleHandle    : 0xffffffff`fffffffd Void
   +0x018 ConsoleFlags     : 0
   +0x020 StandardInput    : (null) 
   +0x028 StandardOutput   : 0x00000000`000013fc Void
   +0x030 StandardError    : (null) 
   +0x038 CurrentDirectory : _CURDIR
   +0x050 DllPath          : _UNICODE_STRING ""
   +0x060 ImagePathName    : _UNICODE_STRING "C:\Windows\System32\bitsadmin.exe"
   +0x070 CommandLine      : _UNICODE_STRING ""C:\Windows\System32\bitsadmin.exe" /rawreturn /nowrap /list /allusers /verbose"
   +0x080 Environment      : 0x000002e1`6e9d6648 Void
   ... (the output continues)
```
- use `dx` to evaluate C++ Expressions
- `da | db | dw | dd | dq [address|range]` - display memory at given virtual addresses: as ascii chars, as bytes + ascii, as machine words (2 bytes), as double-words (4 bytes), as quad-words (8 bytes)
- `!db | !dd | !dq [physical address]` - display memory at specified physical address
- `k` - stack trace

#### Function arguments

When debugging, it's useful to see the function arguments.

The first 4 arguments are in: rcx, rdx, r8, r9. Also, the caller allocates a shadow space in stack for them (4 quadwords), but the caller does not 
store the arguments in this space (it's reserved for the callee)


```
kd> dq /c1 rsp
fffffd08`ee125dc8  fffff801`71222935 --> the return address. only relevant inside the function
fffffd08`ee125dd0  00000025`196fdb50 --> arg1 shadow
fffffd08`ee125dd8  00000000`00000000 --> arg2 shadow
fffffd08`ee125de0  00000000`00000000 --> arg3 shadow
fffffd08`ee125de8  00000000`00000000 --> arg4 shadow
fffffd08`ee125df0  00007fff`00000002 --> arg5
fffffd08`ee125df8  00000025`196fda48 --> arg6
fffffd08`ee125e00  ffffb484`5254e080 --> arg7
fffffd08`ee125e08  fffff801`71449ebf --> ar8
fffffd08`ee125e10  00000000`00000000 -->....
fffffd08`ee125e18  00000000`00000000
```


It's also useful to be able to extract function arguments of previous calls in the callstack. In 32 bit, windbg supports reading function
arguments from the stack using the 'kv' command. Say we are debugging this code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct OBJ {
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
} OBJ, *POBJ;

int AddValues1(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int AddValues2(int a, int b)
{
    return AddValues1(a, b);
}

OBJ AddObjects(POBJ Obj1, POBJ Obj2)
{
    OBJ Obj3 = { 0 };
    Obj3.a = AddValues2(Obj1->a, Obj2->a);
    return Obj3;
}

int main()
{
    OBJ Obj1 = { 0 };
    OBJ Obj2 = { 0 };

    Obj1.a = 1;
    Obj1.b = 2;
    Obj1.c = 3;
    Obj2.a = 4;
    Obj2.b = 5;
    Obj2.c = 6;

    printf("Obj1 Address: 0x%p\n", &Obj1);
    printf("Obj2 Address: 0x%p\n", &Obj2);

    AddObjects(&Obj1, &Obj2);

    return 0;
}
```

The following example will show how to extract the 32 bit arguments:

```
0:000> bp AddValues1
0:000> g
Breakpoint 0 hit
eax=00000004 ebx=01059000 ecx=00000001 edx=00000001 esi=00891a40 edi=0133fc58

    [+0x008] c                : 6 [Type: int]

```

In 64 bit things are a bit more complicated because the calling conventions do not pass the 4 first arguments on the stack, but on registers.
The KV command still tries to read the arguments from the stack, from the shadow space of passed arguments. So, if the file is compiled
in debug mode, it can have valid arguments when using KV. In case the arguments are not saved in the shadow space, we can still try to extract
them by tracing the flow of register usage and seeing whether the value is saved in the stack somewhere. In some cases the parameter is lost because
it's not saved anywhere on the stack. If we are lucky the parameter is saved somewhere and we can read it.

The way I typically do this is to disassemble the function from the callstack, and see if the arguments are saved in the shadow space. If they are I use
the KV command to extract the arguments, or use the Child SP value with ```dq /c1 @rsp```



## Processes

- cid - CID in the windows structures means client id. Most of the time it refers to a ProcessId or a ThreadId but 
sometimes it's both in the same struct. (The struct CLIENT_ID contains UniqueProcessId and UniqueThreadId)

### Current Process

- <code>!process</code> - Dump current process information

```

This is how to show a little bit information about the current process:

```
kd> !process -1 0

```

### Searching for processes

- Use the "!process" command with wildcards: <code>!process "Windows*"</code>

### Moving to the context of a certain process

Moving between process contexts allows placing breakpoints on the process (in user mode), seeing the state of the process, 
searching symbols (because the symbols are loaded)
  
- Get the EPROCESS address : <code>!process 0 0 myproc.exe</code>
- Use the address to switch context: <code>.process /i <EPROCESS address></code>
- Continue until the scheduler switches to the desired process context: <code>g</code>

```
kd> .process /i ffff998ba6f6e280
You need to continue execution (press 'g' <enter>) for the context
to be switched. When the debugger breaks in again, you will be in
the new process context.
kd> g

That allows us to put breakpoints in the context of this process.

### Debugging User Mode Code From a Kernel Debugging Session

Note that the Timestamp and Checksum of the image must be valid. If the image doesn't have a valid checksum/timestamp, windbg will not
be able to load the symbols. Compiling the executable with vs2019 results in an invalid checksum by default (on debug builds) because
of a feature called "incremental build". It's best to debug the process with release builds or disable incremental builds.

Add the .pdb path of your user mode application into the source file path. Without doing so, WinDbg might get stuck if you use reload /f
while trying to get the symbols (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38062216/windbg-cant-find-microsoft-symbols).
After that, perform <code>.reload</code> to reload symbols (in the context of this process). Then, "lm" should show the user mode
image that you are debugging.

That will allow to put breakpoints by using symbols from this image. :)

## Debugging RPC 

- Set a breakpoint on RPC method invocation: ```bp RPCRT4!Invoke```

To get the THREAD id, use the following structures:

```C

PTHREAD ThreadPtr = Teb->ReservedForNtRpc ^ 0x0ABABABABDEDEDEDE;

class THREAD { 
	ULONGLONG ThreadId; // 0x10
	RpcCallState* RpcMessage; // 0x20
}


class RpcCallState { 
	RpcConnectionInformation* RpcConnectionInfo; // 0x130
	PPORT_MESSAGE PortMessage; // 0x1b8
}

class RpcConnectionInformation { 
	AlpcConnectionInformation* AlpcConnectionInformation; // 0x38
}

class AlpcConnectionInformation { 
	HANDLE PortHandle; // 0xd0
}
```


## Threads

```!thread```


## Pool Allocation Breakpoint

This trick is very useful - it can be used to break when a certain tag is used in an allocation.

```dd nt!PoolHitTag L1``` - read the current pool tag hit
```ed nt!PoolHitTag 'eliF'``` - set the current pool tag hit to 'File'. Each time a file will be allocated, we'll break


## Debugger Expressions

the ```dx``` command is one of the most useful commands of windbg. It can be used to evaluate a C++ like expressions in the debugger.
The reason it's so powerfull is that it let's you access symbol information and javascript windbg scripts.

Some simple examples (More examples later)

## Dotnet Debugging

- .NET Internals: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2005/may/net-framework-internals-how-the-clr-creates-runtime-objects


The SOS (Son Of Strike) Windbg extension can be used to debug .NET processes.

### Origin of the name

*The original name of the CLR team (chosen by team founder and former Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Mike Toutonghi) was "Lighting". Larry Sullivan's dev team created an ntsd extension dll to help facilitate the bootstrapping of v1.0. We called it strike.dll (get it? "Lightning Strike"? yeah, I know, ba'dump bum). PSS really needed this in order to give us information back to the team when it was time to debug nasty stress failures, which are almost always done with the Windows debugger stack. But we didn't want to hand out our full strike.dll, because it contained some "dangerous" commands that if you really didn't have our source code could cause you confusion and pain (even to other Microsoft teams). So I pushed the team to create "Son of Strike" (Simon from our dev takes credit/blame for this), and we shipped it with the product starting with Everett (aka V1.1).*



### Loading the SOS plugin

The SOS windbg extension is loaded from the .NET runtime DLL. First we have to make sure mscorlib is loaded into the process. if not (or, it's a dump) We first put a breakpoint on the MSCORLIB DLL (A .NET DLL that provides the .NET standard libraries)

```
> sxe ld:mscorlib
> g
```

For example:

```
ntdll!RtlUserThreadStart:
00007ffb`0290ce30 4883ec78        sub     rsp,78h
0:007> sxe ld:mscorlib
0:007> g
...
...
ModLoad: 00007ffa`d3500000 00007ffa`d43e4000   C:\windows\assembly\NativeImages_v2.0.50727_64\mscorlib\712d042affe876859328e2d4029c7297\mscorlib.ni.dll
ntdll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14:
00007ffb`0293c574 c3              ret
```
After that, we can run a command to load the SOS plugin from the runtime DLL. the name of the runtime DLL was changed in .NET 4, so we have to specify a different name. 
This command means: Load the "sos" plugin from a loaded DLL.

To determine the version of .NET, you can run 'lm' and see which DLL is loaded:

- mscorwks: .NET 2
- clr: .NET 4

##### .NET 2

```
.loadby sos mscorwks
```

##### .NET 4+

```
.loadby sos clr
```

#### Load SOS in a dump file

In dump files you get from other computers, you need to load dll using an absolute path. So first, you need to find the .net directory that matches the .NET version that you debug (2 vs 4) - then, you need to load sos.dll from this path. For example:

```
.load C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\sos.dll
```

### Loading into a Wow64 dump

There's a bug in sos.dll that it cannot load correctly into a wow64 dump because it "thinks" the target architecture is incorrect.
To solve this, you can use this Windbg plugin: https://github.com/poizan42/soswow64

1. Load the dump into a Windbg x86 debugger. (It sometimes works with Windbgx64 debuggers too)
2. load sos.dll
3. load soswow64.dll
4. switch to wow64 (wow64exts.sw)
5. have fun!

example:

```
0:000> .load C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\SOS.dll
0:000> .load C:\Tools\soswow64\soswow64.dll

### Finding information about a method/type

- ```!dumpdomain``` - List all application domains.
- ```!name2ee * <full method/type/assembly name>``` can be used to find methods/types/assemblies
  - Sometimes classes are missing when using !name2ee. Not sure why.
- ```!dumpmt -md <method_table_address>``` - List all the methods in a method table. Each object has a method table
- ```!DumpMD /d <method_descriptor_address>``` - Show information about a method descriptor.
- ```!ip2md <address>``` - get method descriptor by address. 
- ```!dumpil <descriptor>``` - output IL disassembly of a method
- ```!clrstack``` - show stack trace for CLR ONLY.
- ```!dumpstack``` - show combined stack trace for CLR and native code.
  - This command is not so reliable - it can sometimes show unrelated functions 
- ```!do <object_address>``` - Dump a managed object
- ```!dso``` - Dump the objects on the stack
- ```!threads``` - list the managed threads and can be used to change context to a different thread
- ```!dumpmodule -mt <module>``` - List method tables in a module

### Managed breakpoints

There are 2 ways to put a breakpoint on a managed method:

1. Find the address of jitted code using ```!dumpmd``` and use the regular ```bp``` command.
2. If the method is not jitted yet, you can use the ```!bpmd``` command.

## Conditional breakpoint scripts

### For NtCreateUserProcess
```
$$
$$ NtCreateUserProcess.cbp
$$
$$ WinDbg conditional breakpoint script for NtCreateUserProcess
$$
$$ Expected to be called like this (put your string pattern here):
$$ as ${/v:ProcessNameStringPattern} "*calc*"
$$ bp nt!NtCreateUserProcess "$$<D:\\ws\\NtCreateUserProcess.cbp"
$$
$$
r $t0 = poi(@rsp + 8*9)
r $t1 = poi(@$t0 + 0x68)
.printf "### NtCreateUserProcess(%mu) ###\n", @$t1
.if (@$t1 != 0) { as /mu ${/v:ImagePathName} @$t1 } .else { ad /q ${/v:ImagePathName} }
.if ($spat(@"${ImagePathName}", @${ProcessNameStringPattern}) == 0) { gc } .else { .printf "### Breaking in... ###\n" }
```
Example: [NtCreateUserProcess.cbp](NtCreateUserProcess.cbp)

### For NtCreateNamedPipeFile
```
$$
$$ NtCreateNamedPipeFile.cbp
$$
$$ WinDbg conditional breakpoint script for NtCreateNamedPipeFile
$$
$$ Expected to be called like this (put your string pattern here):
$$ as ${/v:PipeNameStringPattern} "*InitShutdown*"
$$ bp nt!NtCreateNamedPipeFile "$$<D:\\ws\\NtCreateNamedPipeFile.cbp"
$$
$$
r $t0 = poi(@r8 + 0x10)
r $t1 = poi(@$t0 + 0x8)
.printf "### NtCreateNamedPipeFile(%mu) ###\n", @$t1
.if (@$t1 != 0) { as /mu ${/v:PipeName} @$t1 } .else { ad /q ${/v:PipeName} }
.if ($spat(@"${PipeName}", @${PipeNameStringPattern}) == 0) { gc } .else { .printf "### Breaking in... ###\n" }
```
Example: [NtCreateNamedPipeFile.cbp](NtCreateNamedPipeFile.cbp)

### Conditional breakpoint example for nt!NtCreateUserProcess

- `!process 0 0 cmd.exe` - get EPROCESS address by the process image name
- `bp /p ffffc80f13092080 nt!NtCreateUserProcess`- set breakpoint in kernel code only for the given process 
- `r $t0 = poi(@rsp+8*9)` - get pointer to _RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS structure from call stack (9-th parameter of NtCreateUserProcess())
- `??((ntdll!_RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS*)@$t0)->ImagePathName.Buffer` - check the name of the process
- `dt ntdll!_RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS @$t0` - note the offset of the ImagePathName.Buffer field in the structure, in this case it's 0x68
- `r $t1 = poi(@$t0 + 0x68)` - get pointer to UTF-16 string of the full path to process
- `as /mu ${/v:ImageName} @$t1` - create alias "ImageName" that references the string in memory
- `.if ($spat(@"${ImageName}", "*calc*")) {.echo ok} .else {.echo nok}` - perform search of the pattern in the memory, referenced by ImageName alias


### Conditional breakpoint example for nt!NtCreateUserProcess with given image path
The example below sets a breakpoint on nt!NtCreateUserProcess in the given cmd.exe process, only when it creates calc.exe process  

1. Create the following WinDbg commands file `d:\ws\windbg-breapoint-NtCreateUserProcess.txt`:
```
r $t0 = poi(@rsp + 8*9)
r $t1 = poi(@$t0 + 0x68)
.if (@$t1 != 0) { as /mu ${/v:ImagePathName} @$t1 } .else { ad /q ${/v:ImagePathName} }
.if ($spat(@"${ImagePathName}", "*calc*") == 0) { gc } .else { .echo ImagePathName }
```

2. Reference the commands file from WinDbg:
```
bp /p ffff9381c148b080 nt!NtCreateUserProcess "$$<D:\\ws\\windbg-breakpoint-NtCreateUserProcess.txt"
```

### Stepping from User mode into Kernel mode in WinDbg + VirtualKD-redux
Shown below is a simple demo of breaking on user part and single stepping into kernel part on notepad.exe for file->open from menu (this will trigger the break on NtCreateFile)

Look for specific binary (notepad.exe in your case and set process specific breakpoint on user stub in ntdll and executive implementation on kernel.
```
1: kd> $$ look for relevent process
1: kd> !process 0 0 notepad.exe
PROCESS ffffc50d96c97080

    Image: notepad.exe

1: kd> bp /p ffffc50d96c97080 ntdll!NtCreateFile
1: kd> bp /p ffffc50d96c97080 nt!NtCreateFile

     1 e Disable Clear  fffff800`4f8914e0     0001 (0001) nt!NtCreateFile
     Match process data ffffc50d`96c97080
```
Execute and let the target run using `g`, and after that it can be stepped with `p`
